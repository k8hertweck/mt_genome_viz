# mt_genome_viz

Visualization of the human mitochondrial genome

Circular visualization of the human mitochondrial genome using R and circos. 

To create Figure 1 from [Hertweck and Dasgupta, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2017.00262/full):
* execute `mt_genome.R` from the project directory.
* from `circos/`, execute `PATH/TO/CIRCOS/circos -conf circos.conf`

Additional scripts with example code from R packages for circular visualization are in `examples`.
